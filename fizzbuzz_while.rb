#FIZZBUZZ WHILE :))
#Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
#But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the 
#number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For 
#numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


number =1
	while number <=100
		if (number % 3) == 0 && (number % 5) == 0
			puts "FizzBuzz"
		elsif number % 3 == 0
			puts "Fizz"
		elsif number % 5 == 0
			puts "Buzz"
		else
			puts number
		end
	number+=1
